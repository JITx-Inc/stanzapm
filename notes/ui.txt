[===== Build System =====]

Use Case:
  1. I am working on a large collection of packages, each in their own
  files. They are constantly in a state of development.
  2. I now write a small program (perhaps a test program) that imports
  a package.
  3. I want to compile the small program with the most up-to-date
  version of its dependencies as possible.
